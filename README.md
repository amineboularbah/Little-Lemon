# Little Lemon Food Ordering App

This project is the culmination of the **iOS App Capstone**, part of the **Meta iOS Developer Professional Certificate** program. The Little Lemon app is a food ordering platform that enables users to explore the restaurant's menu and manage their personal profiles.

While the current version satisfies the certification requirements, I plan to expand its functionality as part of my ongoing iOS development journey. Future updates will include enhanced features such as account creation, order tracking, interactive maps, and more.

## üé® Wireframe  

The app's Home screen design is inspired by the wireframe below. However, slight modifications were made: the **Profile Screen** now exists only in the **bottom navigation bar**, removing its duplicate placement in the top bar.
